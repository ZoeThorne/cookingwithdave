No problem. Don't eat meat? I'll prepare some veggie recipes for you. Want a lesson with a small group of friends? We can arrange that, as long as there's space for everyone!
                    <br><br>Fees include travel and a full set of recipes/notes for you to keep but ingredients are separate. Either you can provide them or I will bring them (at reasonable supermarket prices!). And of course, you get to keep and eat everything we cook. The hardest decision will be what to eat first!

                        Already know how to cook a few meals but want to up your game? Do you feel your food is a bit bland but don't want to follow complicated recipes just for family meals?
                        <br><br>
                        You don't need expensive ingredients and hours of spare time to whip up a tasty meal. We'll work on a handful of basic recipes, such as a simple but flavoursome bolognaise and a base white sauce - which you can then adapt to make dozens of great home meals.

                        Even simple family meals can suddenly become complicated when you or a loved one has a dietary requirement. But just because your food needs to be sugar-free or gluten-free, that doesn't mean it has to be flavour-free as well!

                        As a diabetic myself, with decades of experience of cooking and baking to suit different dietary needs, I can show you how to make simple substitutions to make your life easier and tastier.
